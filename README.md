Contributing
---

We accept pull requests for translations or bug fixes.  If you plan to add a new feature or change existing behaviour we advise you to get in contact with us first, as we are likely to refuse any pull requests which are not part of our roadmap for BlueJ/Greenfoot.  One of the reasons for BlueJ and Greenfoot's success is their simplicity, which has been achieved by being very conservative in which features we choose to add.
