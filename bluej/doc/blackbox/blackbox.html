<div class="heading">BlueJ Blackbox Data Collection Project</div>

<p>
The BlueJ Blackbox data collection project is an initiative by the
developers of BlueJ to collect data on how BlueJ is used, in order to
increase understanding of how students learn to program.  The data
collected is for the purposes of academic research, and will only be
used by computing education researchers.
</p>

<span class="question-heading" id="what_data">What data will be sent?</span>

<div class="answer">
The main data that will be sent is the
(<a href="#anon">anonymised</a>) source code from your projects.  We
also record the use of the BlueJ interface: for example, which methods
are invoked, use of the codepad, use of the debugger, and how you use
other features of BlueJ.  No identifying information (e.g. username)
will be sent with the data.
</div>

<span class="question-heading" id="who">Who will the data be sent to?</span>

<div class="answer">
The data will be sent to a server hosted at the University of Kent in the UK.
Researchers at the University of Kent will have access to the data in order to
analyse it, and access will also be provided to other recognised computing
education researchers for the purpose of analysis.
</div>


<span class="question-heading" id="anon">How will the data be anonymised?</span>

<div class="answer">
No identifying information (e.g. username, machine name) is sent to the
server.  The name of the project is sent, but the full path (which probably
contains your username) is not.  Source code is sent, but all comments before
the class begins are blanked out -- that is, the top comment before your class
will be blanked, as that typically contains your name.  All other code (and
comments) are sent to the server.
</div>

<span class="question-heading" id="traffic">How much traffic will this
  generate?</span>

<div class="answer">
The exact rate at which data will be sent is dependent on the actions
you are performing and the size of your source code base.  As an
estimate, we believe for a handful of small classes (e.g. the projects
accompanying the textbook) that the upload will
be around 3-4 Megabytes each hour of continued use, and the download
will be around 1 Megabyte each hour.  As a quick point of comparison,
loading the BBC news front page once involves downloading around 0.5
Megabytes of data and uploading 0.06 Megabytes.
</div>

<span class="question-heading" id="opt_in_out">How can I opt in/out?</span>

<div class="answer">
To change your participation in this research, in BlueJ 3.1.0 and later, go to
the Preferences window, and under the Miscellaneous tab there is an option to
change your current participation.
</div>


<span class="question-heading" id="repeated">Why do I repeatedly get asked if
  I want to opt in?</span>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Your participation status is stored in BlueJ's properties file.  This is
stored in your user profile directory on your machine.  For a home machine, or
a school network which supports persistent profiles, you should be asked once,
and this decision stored thereafter.
</p>

<p>However if your network does not keep your profile, you will be asked every
  time you load BlueJ, because BlueJ cannot tell that you have been asked
  before.  In this case, you will need to contact your network administrator
  and tell them to either let profiles persist (the ideal solution), or
  otherwise to alter the bluej.defs file supplied with BlueJ to include the
  line:</p>

<pre>blackbox.uuid=optout</pre>
</div>

<span class="question-heading" id="global_optout">I'm a network administrator; how I do
  disable participation for my users?</span>

<div class="answer">
<p>
  If you want to opt-out your users by default but still allow them to
  choose to opt-in later, you can alter the bluej.defs file that is
  install with BlueJ to include the line:
</p>
<pre>blackbox.uuid=optout</pre>
<p>
  Alternatively, if you want to opt-out your users and prevent them
  from re-enabling participation, we have provided an alternate BlueJ
  release that completely disables the data participation mechanism.
  You can <a href="http://www.bluej.org/download/files/bluej-310b.msi">download
  the release here</a> -- it should act as a drop-in 
  replacement for the usual BlueJ installer.
